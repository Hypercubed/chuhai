# Ch큰hai

Test driven benchmarking.

## Why Ch큰hai?

What's more useless than micro-benchmarks micro-optimization?  Micro-benchmarks without tests to ensure they are doing what you think they are doing.  I've seen it more that once.  I've done it many times myself.  Ch큰hai is my attempt to fix that by combining testing and benchmarks.

## Features

* Runs alongside multiple assertion libraries and test runners: [node-assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html), [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape), [blue-tape](https://github.com/spion/blue-tape).
* Runs in the browser using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify), [testling](https://github.com/substack/testling), and  [browser-run](https://github.com/juliangruber/browser-run).

## Install

```sh
npm i --save-dev chuhai
```

## Usage

Create a file named bench.js:

**example using node and assert, see below for other setups**

```js
var assert = require('assert');
var suite = require('chuhai');

// starts a new benchmark suite
suite('array concat', function (s) {
  var arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
  var arr2 = ['d', 'e', 'f'];
  var arr3 = null;

  // run between each benchmark
  s.cycle(function () {
    // uses your assertion lib of choice
    assert.deepEqual(arr3, ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']);
    arr3 = null;
  });

  // adds a bench that runs but doesn't get counted when comparing results to others.
  s.burn('slice', function () {
    arr3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'].slice();
  });

  // adds a bench.
  s.bench('concat', function () {
    arr3 = arr1.concat(arr2);
  });

  // adds a bench.
  s.bench('for loop', function () {
    var i;
    var l1 = arr1.length;
    var l2 = arr2.length;
    arr3 = Array(l1 + l2);
    for (i = 0; i < l1; i++) {
      arr3[i] = arr1[i];
    }
    for (var i2 = 0; i2 < l2; i2++) {
      arr3[i + i2] = arr2[i2];
    }
  });
});
```

Run using node (or babel-node or tape, see below)

```sh
node bench.js
```

## Test runners/Assertion libraries

Ch큰hai is designed to work well with test runners and assertion libraries such as:

- [node-assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) - [example](./test/fixtures/assert)
- [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) - [example](./test/fixtures/ava)
- [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) - [example](./test/fixtures/tape)
- [blue-tape](https://github.com/spion/blue-tape) - [example](./test/fixtures/bluetape)

as well as in-browser runners such as (combined with  [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and node-assert, Tape, or blue-tape):

- [testling](https://github.com/substack/testling) - [example](https://github.com/Hypercubed/chuhai/blob/master/package.json#L12)
- [browser-run](https://github.com/juliangruber/browser-run) - [example](https://github.com/Hypercubed/chuhai/blob/master/package.json#L13)

**More details coming soon**

## API

```js
// creates a new benchmark suite
suite([title: string], implementation: function): promise
```

### function implementation(s) {}

```js
// creates a new benchmark test
s.bench(title: string, implementation: function)
```

```js
// creates a burn-in benchmark test
s.burn(title: string, implementation: function)
```

```js
// runs between benchmarks (place assertions checks here)
s.cycle(implementation: function)
```

```js
// sets benchmark/suite options
s.set(key: string, value: any)
```
